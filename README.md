# Overview
This repo contains the collateral to facilitate the *Understanding threat landscape using Threat Composer* workshop at AWS Community Day Bengaluru happening on 24 May 2025, Saturday.

## Description
This hands-on workshop introduces threat modeling as a proactive security practice essential for AWS workloads. Participants will learn to model data flows and to systematically identify, assess, and mitigate security risks before deployment using the STRIDE methodology and Threat Composer. Through practical exercises, attendees will develop skills to protect cloud architectures, reduce security costs, and foster collaboration between development and security teams. The workshop balances theoretical concepts with practical application on real AWS architectures.

## What to expect
1. Learn fundamental threat modeling concepts and their application to AWS environments
2. Develop practical skills in creating data flow diagrams for cloud architectures
3. Apply the STRIDE methodology to identify and categorize potential security threats
4. Use Threat Composer to document, prioritize, and track security concerns
5. Participate in hands-on exercises analyzing common AWS architectural patterns
6. Engage in collaborative threat analysis in small groups

## Prerequisites
1. Basic understanding of common AWS services
2. Familiarity with general security concepts
3. No prior threat modeling experience required

## Target audience
Cloud architects designing AWS solutions
Engineers building on/for the cloud
Tech leads responsible for secure delivery
Product owners concerned with compliance and security risks
Anyone interested in building security into their AWS applications from design
