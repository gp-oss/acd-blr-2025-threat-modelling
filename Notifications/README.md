Notification System Overview

The notification service consists of three key boundary contexts working together to deliver secure, scalable communications:
Component	Purpose	Responsibilities
Notification Core	->      Orchestration Engine	->    Event validation, routing, workflow management, PII handling
Notification Vendor	->    Delivery Management -> 	    Channel delivery (email, SMS, push), vendor integration, delivery tracking
Notification Template-> 	Content Manement ->	        Template storage, personalization, content validation, localization

How They Work Together
Consumer Services ‚Üí [Notification Core] ‚Üí [Notification Vendor] ‚Üí External Channels
                           ‚Üì
                    [Notification Template]

Consumer services send notification requests to Notification Core
Notification Core validates requests and fetches content from Notification Template
Notification Core orchestrates delivery through Notification Vendor
Notification Vendor handles actual delivery via external channels (SendGrid, etc.)
Vendor listens and report back delivery status and engagement metrics


üéØ Focus: Notification Core BC Threat Model

This presentation focuses specifically on the Notification Core component - the critical orchestration engine that:
  1. Receives and validates notification requests from internal services
  2. Handles sensitive PII data (emails, phone numbers, contact info)
  3. Manages workflow orchestration and business rules
  4. Integrates with Template and Vendor components
  5. Processes 100K-1M notification events

Why Focus on Notification Core?
  1. Highest Risk Component: Handles the most sensitive data and integrations
  2. Central Attack Surface: Single point where most threats converge
  3. Critical Business Function: System failure impacts all notification channels
  4. Complex Data Flows: Multiple integration points requiring security analysis
